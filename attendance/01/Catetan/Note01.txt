Android is Software stack for mobile devices

Main Components in Android Application :
1. Activity = representation of application’s screen.
2. Services = background process that is used to perform long-running operations. ex: playing music in background, alarm, GPS, message receiver.
3. Broadcast Receiver = component that allows the application to send and receive events to/from other applications. ex.: receive battery status warning, send phone in calling status
4. Content Provider = component to manage a set of data from any source.

Intents = Allows an activity, service or broadcast receiver to link to another


An Activity displays the user interface. User Interfaces are built from View and ViewGroup object instances of the View class. View objects are data structures that store content and layout parameters 
-controls a specific rectangular region of the screen
-responsible for drawing itself
-handles events
Subclass  “widgets” provide user interface objects:
-text fields, buttons, labels
-serves as means of interaction with user


ViewGroup objects act like containers for View objects. one or more Views are grouped together
Subclass “layouts” provide different layout architectures:
- LinearLayout – displays Views in linear direction either horizontally or vertically
- RelativeLayout – displays Views in relative position to each other
- TableLayout – displays Views in table form with rows and columns
- Some other layouts from base class android.view.ViewGroup:AbsoluteLayout, FrameLayout, ScrollView


Input Events
Define to inform the system of user interaction
Event listener is defined  and registered with the View object
- View class has a collection of On<SomeEvent>Listener:
- View.OnClickListener
- View.OnTouchListener
- View.OnKeyListener


Application Menus
Two types of menus
Options menu –  typically when an application is running
accessed by pressing the MENU button on the device
Context menu – typically used for displaying specific information about an item
accessed by pressing and hold down on an object


Sensors = public class SensorActivity extends Activity, implements SensorEventListener { …


Bluetooth 
BluetoothAdapter - Local radio state, Discover devices
BluetoothServerSocket - Receives connection requests ,Returns a BluetoothSocket when connected
BluetoothSocket - InputStream object ,OutputStream object


Location
LocationManager locman = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE)
Location loc = locman.getLastKnownLocation(String provider)
